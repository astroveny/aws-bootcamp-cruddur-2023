# Week 2

## Distributed Tracing

During this stage we will intigrate with our distributed system an obeserbavility solution (**Honeycomb**) that will be used to monitor and observe requests as they flow through the distributed services. Using disributed tracing will simplify debugging, verify and compare services response time and spotting unusual patterns.
This would allow us to see and understand how the distributed services handle a single request and apply changes as required.

### Honeycomb Setup

- Create a new Environment "**bootcamob**"
- Create an API key for each service
- Update the API key for each service ENV variables
